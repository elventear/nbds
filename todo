+ fix makefile to compute dependency info as a side-effect of compilation (-MF)
+ support integer keys for ht
+ optimize tracing code, still too much overhead
+ use NULL instead of a sentinal node in skiplist and list
+ make the interfaces for all data structures consistent 
+ make list and skiplist use string keys
+ optimize integer keys
+ ht_print()
+ iterators
- make rcu yield when its buffer gets full instead of throwing an assert
- alternate memory reclamation schemes, hazard pointers and/or reference count
- investigate 16 byte CAS; ht can store GUIDs inline instead of pointers to actual keys 
- document usage
- document algorithms
- port tests from lib-high-scale
- 32 bit version of hashtable
- verify list and skiplist work on 32 bit platforms
- transaction tests
- validate the arguments to interface functions
- shortcut from write-set to entries/nodes
- use a shared scan for write-set validation, similar to ht copy logic
- characterize the performance of hashtable, list and skiplist
- experiment with the performance impact of not passing the hash between functions in ht
- experiment with embedding the keys in the list/skiplist nodes
- allow values of 0 to be inserted into maps (change DOES_NOT_EXIST to something else)
- see if it's possible to rename nbd_malloc to malloc
