+ fix makefile to compute dependency info as a side-effect of compilation (-MF)
+ support integer keys for ht
+ optimize tracing code, still too much overhead
+ use NULL instead of a sentinal node in skiplist and list
+ make the interfaces for all data structures consistent 
+ make list and skiplist use string keys
+ optimize integer keys
+ ht_print()
+ iterators
+ 32 bit support

memory manangement
------------------
- make rcu yield when its buffer gets full instead of throwing an assert
- alternate memory reclamation schemes: hazard pointers and/or reference counting
- verify the key management in list, skiplist, and hashtable
- seperate nbd_malloc/nbd_free into general purpose malloc/free replacement

quality
-------
- transaction tests
- port perf tests from lib-high-scale
- characterize the performance of hashtable, list and skiplist
- validate arguments in interface functions
- document usage of the library
- document algorithms

optimization
------------
- investigate 16 byte CAS; ht can store GUIDs inline instead of pointers to actual keys 
- shortcut from write-set to entries/nodes
- use a shared scan for write-set validation, similar to ht copy logic
- experiment with the performance impact of not passing the hash between functions in ht
- experiment with embedding the keys in the list/skiplist nodes

features
--------
- allow values of 0 to be inserted into maps (change DOES_NOT_EXIST to something else)
