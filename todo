- make rcu wait when its buffer gets full, instead of crashing
- fix makefile to compute dependency info as a side-effect of compilation (-MF)
- investigate 16 byte CAS; ht can store GUIDs inline instead of pointers to actual keys 
- test ht
+ optimize tracing code, still too much overhead
+ use NULL instead of a sentinal node in skiplist and list
- make interfaces for all data structures consistent 
+ make list and skiplist use string keys
- optimize short strings by embedding the data directly in their pointers
